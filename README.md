# Tesselix CLI

### Created by: [iamendor](https://github.com/iamendor/iamendor)

This is an extension of my matrix library [Tesselix](https://github.com/iamendor/Tesselix). This program contains a user friendly matrix CLI, like Octave.

## Usage

To use you need to build the [Tesselix](https://github.com/iamendor/Tesselix) library and move it to the <code>lib</code> folder. If you ready with that you can use <code>make</code> to build the program.

```
> make && ./bin/main
```

## More about the CLI

The CLI gives most of the equipments to operate with matrices, you can also save immediately after exit to go right back where you started! The CLI contains all functionality of the Tesselix library.
